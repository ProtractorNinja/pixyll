# The Hassle

- Assignment: build a collection of ocaml functions (simple operations on int list list, mostly)
- Annoyance: only provided test is a big script that dumps all values, only checkable with diff of complete program output (hard to test during dev)
- Must make log of 2+ function output (in ocaml interpreter)
- I wanted to do unit tests, and didn't want to have to retype everything to log it

# Looking Back

- Python is great
- Solution was not scalable or very general but worked well
- Code coverage would have been nice (almost missed some test cases in regex), but would be weird to implement
